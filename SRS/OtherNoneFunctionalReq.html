    		<h2>5.	Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>
        <h3>5.1	Performance Requirements</h3>
        <p>Performance is one of our fundamental points of view. Full performance with lite size of programming is exceptionally mainstream among all individuals. Every one of the quires and algorithms written in little size of data. All capacity handled in under 1 second. One capacity to another capacity work exceptionally as quick as could be expected under the circumstances. Furthermore, form updates will take couple of moment to finish and dependably will be lite version with larger function. The divide algorithm will utilize and it takes quick to run application.  
        </p>
        <h3>5.2	Safety Requirements</h3>
        <p>In the event that there is broad harm to wide piece of the database because of cataclysmic failure, for example, a plate crash, the recuperation technique reestablishes a past duplicate of the database that was went down to recorded capacity and modifies a more present state by answer or re-trying the activities of submitted exchanges from the moved down log, up to the things that harmed.

</p>
       <h3>5.3	Security Requirements</h3>
       <p>Security systems need database storage just like many other applications. User can sign up their account by email id and can also by Google and Facebook id (if they have).Individual form's informations of different event will be taken with a serious security matter, only event owner and admin can access those information.If user forgot their password they can reset by email. 
         
       </p>

       <h3>5.4	Software Quality Attributes</h3>
       <p><b><i>Availability:</i></b> The Competition event's information is available one the specified date to expire date by organizers information date. If event registration deadline is finished then organizers close their given information. And in database it will be automatically deleted.<br>
<b><i>Correctness:</i></b> In Google map will correct the event or compitition destination with correct event location. Clock will adjust the international time of the event.<br>
<b><i>Maintainability:</i></b> The administrator of this application will maintain the application with honestly and if find any bug in software then will take necessary steps to solve that problem.

      </p>

   <h3>5.5	Business Rules</h3>
   <p>Application will completely free for candidates yet for coordinators if anyone needs too boost their event or competition they can pay for packages . They can pay by every hour or they can purchase bundle like day by day, month to month and yearly. In hourly or day by day boosting may get some markdown. Customary client may get some additional markdown utilizing uncommon promo codes and in addition new clients as well. Other than that we can profit from offering advertisement spaces to the organizations.
